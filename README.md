# Movie_Recommendation
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python, FastAPI, and Streamlit. It provides personalized movie suggestions based on either a movie title or director input. The system analyzes movie genres and directors to recommend similar movies, making it easier for users to discover films matching their interests.
